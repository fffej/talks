# What is Legacy Code?
Aim of this section is to define what legacy code is
Final destination is quite broad
Legacy code is code that you aren't confident in changing

# What's it like working in a legacy code base

Aim of this section is to describe just how difficult the cost to change is.  

Fear of change

just one more parameter won't hurt

Code that reads sensibly, but doesn't do what it says

# How does Legacy Code get created?
Is it because people are stupid?  No! People make the best decisions with the information they have

Initial design was good, changes in requirements necessitated changes in the design, but either changes not considered (comfort zone?) or the perceived cost to change not too much (perhaps exploring a feature area that was unforeseen but then took off)
